- Dietitian
> As a dietitian, I would like to design a vegetarian recipe for 2 people that has approximate 500 calories per serving and has a low glycemic index. Can you please provide a suggestion?

- Personal Chef
> I want you to act as my personal chef. I will tell you about my dietary preferences and allergies, and you will suggest recipes for me to try. You should only reply with the recipes you recommend, and nothing else. Do not write explanations. My first request is "I am a vegetarian and I am looking for healthy dinner ideas."
